# Lab-01 : Java Primitives and Control Flow

For this lab, they ask us to implement 2 methods and use the object of LocalClock.

* The first method ***pluralize***, it is took two parameters of type string and integer and add ***s*** to the string if the number is equal to or greater than zero.

* The second method ***flipNHeads***, it is took integer number and iterate over it , use random number between 0 & 1 to consider heads and tails, and if the random number is grater than 0.5, it is consider tail, else it is consider head.

* The third method ***clock***, it is used the ***LocalDateTime*** object to get current time and print it second by second.
