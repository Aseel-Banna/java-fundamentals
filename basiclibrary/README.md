# Basics Library 

For today's lab, I created a test file before start working to know what is the expected output of each method that will be created in the main class.
Then, methods are created to reach the expected output in the test file.


# Lab 3: Maps

I used the October Seattle weather data above to Iterate through all of the data to find the min and max values. I solved this method using a HashSet of type Integer to keep track of all the unique temperatures seen. 
Finally, I iterated from the min temp to the max temp and created a String containing any temperature not seen during the month and returning that String.

Also, I wrote a function called tally that accepts a List of Strings representing votes and returns one string to show what got the most votes.
