# Lab 6: Interfaces and Inheritance

In this lab, we create two classes Review Class and Restaurant Class.
The Review Class is inherited from Restaurant Class, so the Review Class can access all variables that are declared in the Review Class.
Also, there is a test file included with this lab.

# Lab 7: Inheritance, day 2

In this lab, we create two other classes Theater Class and Shop Class.
The Theater Class is inherited from Review Class, so it can access all variables that are declared in the Review Class.
The user should add review for either restaurant, shop or theater. But the difference between review for shop or restaurant and theater review that the theater review has an additional parameter for movie name, so I created a new class called MoviesReview Class to add the review for a movie.
